# weather-api
This program allows a user to obtain certain weather information through OpenWeatherMap's free API.

Data about the weather in a certain location will be displayed if you choose the PyOWM module option.
A file of weather data in JSON format will be created if you choose the standard HTTP request option.

To use the progran, run main.py. Make sure that the requests module and pyowm module are already installed.
